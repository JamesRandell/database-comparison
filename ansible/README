For a cassandra build in a VM, you will need to first use WSL, then run the following:

# configure pip to use pip 3. Can do this for python too
# By default, 'python' points to 2.7, so lets change it to 3.6 (or higher)
alias pip=pip3
alias python=python3.8

# For the very first use of Ansible, or to upgrade it I had to jump through the following hoops:
# This was done in WSL

# On my WSL install, Ansible was installed via apt and not PIP, if you try to remove or upgrade ansible with pip you'll get the following error:
# "Not uninstalling ansible at /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages, outside environment /usr"
# So, uninstall it via apt instead:
sudo apt purge ansible
sudo apt -y update

# if you need to reset the command link cache:
hash -d ansible

sudo apt install ansible


# IF we need to re-install python and pip, then this section is for you
# I've noticed pip complains that running it direct will 
# be depracated, so you can run it with python
# this next line is from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

### Some back storey ###
# I was going to use pip to install ansible wit hthe following command: "python -m pip install ansible"
# However, whilst this installed ansible, i couldn't get things like "ansible-playbook" or "ansible-galaxy" to work.
# it complained about "-bin: /usr/bin/ansible-playbook No file..." so in the end I gave up and went with 
# apt as documented above

# for first time use, get some additional modules from galaxy hub
# note we don't actually need this. I was playing around with running powershell
# from Ansible and this is the module to do it (ansible.windows in requirements)
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml --force


cd "/mnt/c/Users/James/Code/Database Comparison/ansible"

# this playbook will take a bit of time. It sets up the VM's and installed all sorts of software from YUM and updates everything
ansible-playbook build-vm.yml -i inventory/inventory.yml

# this one will configure cassandra, so more of an application/service level update
ansible-playbook build-cassandra.yml -i inventory/inventory.yml

# finally, this is cassandra specific, but we open ports
# YOU DON'T NEED THIS: I stuffed this into build-cassandra
# ansible-playbook open-ports.yml -i inventory/inventory.yml
