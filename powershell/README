You'll first need to create a new virtual network switch.
I created an External swtich named "lab" before doing the below steps. If you call it something else make
sure you update the $vmswitch parameter in vm-create

Make sure you're in a powershell terminal, then run the following to re-build the VMs

cd "C:\Users\james\Code\Database Comparison\powershell"

.\vm-create.ps1

# when done:
# this populates the ansible playbook with our created VMs
# it'll take a few seconds after you run vm-create for all the VMs to start up, so re-run get-hosts if some of the entries are missing
.\get-hosts.ps1
